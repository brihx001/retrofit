# Retrofit for Drupal

The Retrofit provides compatibility layers for legacy Drupal code to allow run on any version of Drupal.

## Installation

```shell
composer require mglaman/retrofit-drupal
```

And that's it! ðŸŽ‰

## How it works

This library registers a service provider to integrate with Drupal automatically.

## Usage

Currently, the compatibility layers are drop-in replacements. This means you can use them in your code without any 
changes. Some functions are namespaced for compatibility. 

You must modify your Drupal 7 modules `.info` file to `info.yml`.

* Add `type: module`
* Add `core_version_requirement: >= 10`

### Namespaced functions

* `module_load_include` is now `Retrofit\Drupal\module_load_include`

### Fixing placeholders in `t()`

The `!` placeholder is no longer valid. Placeholders using `!` in `t()` need to be manually changed to `@` or `:`.
